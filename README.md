# Implementation of "Complete and Easy Bidirectional Typechecking for Higher-Rank Polymorphism" by Dunfield and Krishnaswami (2013).

See [arXiv:1306.6032](https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6032)

There are a number of other implementations of this paper, even some in [Typescript](https://github.com/atennapel/bidirectional.js).

This project focusses on implementing the paper fairly directly, but still producing fairly idiomatic and readable Typescript, including unit tests.

I wrote this as a way of understanding the paper, and hope to use it as the basis for further work.
